# react-apps
My journey through learning javascript, react, redux, express, node, etc. Projects are chronologically ordered.

### 1. test-app
Literally just a test app to see if I can run a react app. Turns out I can.

### 2. counter-app
Followed a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0) to create a shopping cart type counter. Lifting states.
