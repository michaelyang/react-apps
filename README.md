# react-apps
My journey through learning html, css, javascript, react, redux, express, node, etc. Projects are chronologically ordered.

## Apps

1. **test-app**

   Literally just a test app to see if I can run a react app. Turns out I can.

2. **counter-app**

   Followed a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0) to create a shopping cart type counter. Lifting states.  
3. **react-express-app**

   Followed [Deploying a React app with React-Router and an Express Backend](https://dev.to/nburgess/creating-a-react-app-with-react-router-and-an-express-backend-33l3). Horrible tutorial btw.
